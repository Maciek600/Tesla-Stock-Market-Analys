/**
 * This package contains the data model classes for the application.
 * 
 * It includes:
 * - {@link Model} which manages the application data and logic,
 * - {@link SalesRecord} which represents individual sales records 
 *   containing relevant information such as date, volume, and closing price.
 * 
 * The model is independent of the view and controller, ensuring 
 * a clear separation of concerns in accordance with the MVC pattern.
